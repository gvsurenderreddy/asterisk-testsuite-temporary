Building asterisk for use with asttest
======================================

Asterisk can be built for use with asttest using the following command.

ASTSRCDIR=/usr/src/asterisk ASTDSTDIR=/tmp/asterisk make asterisk

Where ASTSRCDIR is the path to your asterisk source and ASTDSTDIR is the path 
to the directory where asterisk should be installed.  Asterisk will be built 
then installed in the directory specified.  The asterisk installation will be 
entirely self contained in ASTDSTDIR.  This directory can be passed to asttest 
using the -a flag to tell it to use the new install for testing.

asttest -a /tmp/asterisk my-test-dir

To simply use a pre-existing installation of asterisk on a system, asttest can 
be run as follows.

asttest -a / my-test-dir
