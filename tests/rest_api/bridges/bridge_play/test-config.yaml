    summary: Test detection of PlaybackStarted and PlaybackFinished events
             from bridge topic during bridges/play
    description: |
        This creates a bridge and places a channel in the bridge implicitly
        subscribing to it. Then the test executes the bridges/play ARI command
        to the bridge. The PlaybackStarted and PlaybackFinished events must be
        received in order for the test to be considered successful.
