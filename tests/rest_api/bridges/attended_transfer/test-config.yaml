    summary: Test that ensures attended transfer events are delivered via WebSocket.
    description: |
        "This test originates one call into Stasis():

          Originated Channel -> Stasis()

        It then starts two SIPp scenarios that call into the dialplan:

          SIPp #1 (referer.xml) -> Stasis()
          SIPp #2 (referee.xml) -> Echo()

        The two SIPp scenarios work together via 3PCC mode to pass
        SIPp #2's call information back to SIPp #1 once both calls are up:

          SIPp #2 --3PCC(call information)-> SIPp #1

        The test bridges the two channels in Stasis():

          Originated Channel -> Stasis() -> Bridge -> Stasis() -> SIPp #1

        SIPp #1 then performs an attended transfer using a REFER with
        SIPp #2's call information which results in a Local channel
        passing information between Stasis() and Echo():

          Originated Channel -> Stasis() -> Bridge -> Stasis() -> Local Channel Pair -> Echo()

        Now that the transfer is complete and the transferring channels
        have been hung up, the remaining channels are hung up and the
        test ends."
