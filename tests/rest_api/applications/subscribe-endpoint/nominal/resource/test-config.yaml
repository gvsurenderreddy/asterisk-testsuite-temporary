    summary: Test subscribing to an endpoint from an application.
    description: |
        This test covers nominal subscribing to an endpoint and
        receiving events about that endpoint and a channel associated
        with that endpoint. The test:
        - Subscribes for updates about PJSIP/bob
        - Originates a Local channel that dials an IAX2 endpoint
          (alice/alice) and a PJSIP channel that dial a PJSIP
          endpoint (bob). Both alice and bob are on the ast2
          instance.
        - The test verifies that we receive no updates about the
          IAX2 resource (as we didn't subscribe for it), and that
          we receive endpoint state notifications for the PJSIP
          resource and its channel.
