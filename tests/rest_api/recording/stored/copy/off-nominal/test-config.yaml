    summary: Test off nominal copying of a stored recording.
    description: |
        This test does the following:
        - Makes a recording
        - Verifies that we have a stored recording
        - Attempts to copy a non-existant recording
        - Attempts to overwrite a copy
        All of these are expected to fail with appropriate
        error codes.
