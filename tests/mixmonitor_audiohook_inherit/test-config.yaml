    summary:     'Test MixMonitor with AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT'
    description: |
        'This test verifies basic functionality using MixMonitor with AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT.
         To test this, an extension is called using the console channel driver. MixMonitor
         and AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT are used on that channel and then the channel is transfered
         to another extension.  After the transfer, audio is played back for a period of time. 
         In order to verify AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT worked properly, the file size is checked to verify
         it is the size we would expect.  If AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT did not work properly, the file 
         size would be much smaller than what we expect since we play several seconds of audio after 
         the transfer.'
