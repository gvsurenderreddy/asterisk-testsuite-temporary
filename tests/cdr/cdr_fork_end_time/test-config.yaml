    summary: Test ForkCDR option for ending the original CDR log before starting new one
    description: |
        'This is a normal CDRTestCase test which originates a call to an extension which
         plays some silence, calls ForkCDR with the e option, and then plays more silence
         before hanging up. Afterwards, both CDR records are checked to see that they
         match expected fields and that the duration of both call records is above a
         minimum threshold (both should have noticeable durations). Then the end time of
         the first record is checked to see if it came reasonably close to the beginning
         time of the second (<=1 second to accomodate potential timing differences).'
