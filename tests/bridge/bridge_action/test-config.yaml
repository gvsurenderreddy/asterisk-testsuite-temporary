    summary:     'Test the Bridge AMI Action'
    description: |
        'This tests the bridge AMI action in the following manner:
        * Five Local channels are spawned, all into an Echo application
        * Two pairs of Local channels are chosen and Bridged. This will yank those
          channels from the Echo application.
        * Next, one of the pairs is chosen and a channel from it is Bridged with the
          fifth channel still in the Echo application. This will yank the channel
          from the Echo application and move the other channel into a newly
          created Bridge.
        * Finally, from the remaining original pair a channel is chosen and one of
          the channels from the second round's Bridge is chosen. These are Bridged
          as well. This moves the channels from existing bridges into a new
          Bridge.
        * If all BridgeEnter events are received, the test passes.'
