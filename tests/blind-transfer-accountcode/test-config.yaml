    summary:     'Test account code propagation for SIP blind transfers.'
    description: |
        "This test ensures that when a channel with an account code, dials a
        channel without and account code, then transfers the dialed channel to
        another channel, the calling (and transferring) channel's account code
        is copied to the called channel and stored in the CDR record for the
        transfer.

        This test also ensures that if the called channel has an account code,
        the calling channel's account code is not copied and instead the called
        channel's account code is used."
