    summary:     'Test Chanspy with the \"B\" option for barging in on both channels.'
    description: |
        'This test verifies basic functionality of using ChanSpy with the 
         barge option set. MixMonitor is used to record the audio on the
         spied on channel to verify the barging spy channel audio is received.  
         Also, since the Wait() application is used during barge, this verifies 
         that the default behavior of transmitting silence during ast_safe_sleep remains. 
         Without transmitting silence during wait, the barge audio will not be mixed and
         this test will fail.'
