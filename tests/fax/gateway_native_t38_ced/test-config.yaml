    summary: 'Test the fax gateway.'
    description: |
        This test verifies that the gateway properly disabled itself when the
        two channels involved demonstrated that they can natively do t38. In
        this test, t38 is negotiated with each channel separately (first after
        a CED tone is detected).

        The call flow looks like this:
         |send        |
         |t38      t38|
         |----------->|
         |     gateway|
         |t38      t38|
         |<-----------|
