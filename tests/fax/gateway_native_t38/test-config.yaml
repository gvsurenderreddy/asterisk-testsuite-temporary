    summary: 'Test the fax gateway.'
    description: |
        This test verifies proper gateway functionality when both channels
        involved demonstrate they are capable of native t38. The gateway
        monitors as the two channels negotiate t38 and removes itself when
        negotiation is successful.

        The call flow looks like this:
         |send        |
         |t38      t38|
         |----------->|
         |     gateway|
         |t38      t38|
