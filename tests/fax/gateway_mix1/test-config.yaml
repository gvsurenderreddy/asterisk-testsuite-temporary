    summary: 'Test the fax gateway.'
    description: |
        This test verifies proper gateway functionality when a CED triggered
        t38 negotiation request fails. The gateway should detect a CED tone
        from the receiving side and send a t38 reinvite to the sending side.
        The sending side will reject the reinvite. The gateway should detect
        this and wait for the receiving side to send a T.38 reinvite and then
        gateway the fax.

        The call flow looks like this:
         |send        |
         |g711     t38|
         |----------->|
         |     gateway|
         |t38      t38|
