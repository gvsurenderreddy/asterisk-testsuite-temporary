    summary:     'Test ringinuse and autopause'
    description: |
        "This test accomplishes several tasks. First, it ensures that queue
        members in queues with ringinuse=no are not called. Second, it ensures
        that autopause takes effect properly after a called member does not answer.
        Third, it makes sure that a paused member is not called, even if ringinuse
        is not set to 'no.'
        
        The test also tests some subtle behavior aspects. For instance, we do not
        autopause a member UNLESS he gets called. So in the first test call run, we
        call a busy member who has ringinuse=no. This means that since we didn't even
        attempt to call the member, we will not autopause him."
