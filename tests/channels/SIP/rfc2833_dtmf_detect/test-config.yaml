    summary:     'Test RFC2833 DTMF detection'
    description: |
        "This test places several calls to Asterisk using SIPp. SIPp,
        upon receiving an answer, will use its capability to play pcap
        files to play a set of DTMF tones toward Asterisk. The Read()
        dialplan application is used to detect the tones. Afterward, a
        comparison is made to determine if the detected DTMF is what we
        expected. The test consists of three calls and three sets of DTMF
        to be detected.

        Test 1: The RFC2833 DTMF has no oddities to it. This is a basic detection
        test.

        Test 2: The RFC2833 DTMF has out-of-order packets, thus possibly
        triggering the false detection of duplicate tones.

        Test 3: The first three DTMF digits contain no end frames. Asterisk
        should be able to properly handle the situation and still log the
        DTMF presses."
