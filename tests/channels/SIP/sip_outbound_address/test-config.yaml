    summary:     'Test explicit outbound host for SIP calls'
    description: |
        "This tests the ability to specify an explicit host to send
        an outbound SIP INVITE to. The test works by having two SIPp
        UASs waiting for INVITEs. Each is set to answer an inbound INVITE
        and then send an RFC2833 DTMF digit. Asterisk will read this digit,
        and determine who answered the call. Based on who answered the call,
        we can determine which UAS answered and whether it was the one we
        expected.

        It is possible that this test could be done in a more straightforward
        manner. Suggestions are certainly welcome."
