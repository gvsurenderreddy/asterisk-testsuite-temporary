    summary: 'Test various SIP Hold scenarios in chan_pjsip'
    description: |
        This tests SIP Hold, where one SIP phone puts another SIP phone on hold by
        sending a re-INVITE with a modified SDP containing either a restricted audio
        direction, an IP address of 0.0.0.0, or a combination thereof. Restricted
        audio direction is also tested for unholding by a re-INVITE without an SDP.
