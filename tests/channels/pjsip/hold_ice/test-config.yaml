    summary: 'Test SIP Hold with ICE negotiation in chan_pjsip'
    description: |
        This tests a PJSIP assertion crash detailed somewhat in
        https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-23213 - A call
        is started with ICE enabled. A call is started from A to B with
        some ICE candidates listed that are known to cause a crash
        prior to r405235. The call is then put on hold hold (which is
        the trigger for the crash) and taken off hold. If both the hold
        and unhold events are received and Asterisk doesn't crash, the
        test is considered successful. Note that the direction of media
        is not considered in this test.
