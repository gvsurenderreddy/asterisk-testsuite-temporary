    summary: 'Testing the AlwaysDelete Option of Call File Retries'
    description: |
        'This test basically sets the 'AlwaysDelete' option to no, which
         will ultimately not delete the call file from the outgoing folder
         of the [astspooldir] after the call has been attempted. The test
         uses a UserEvent in order to check that the file was not deleted,
         and that the test ran as expected.'
