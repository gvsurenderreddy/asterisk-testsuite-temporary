    summary:     'Test Retrieval of SIP CHANNEL parameters'
    description: |
        "This test places a call to Asterisk using SIPp. Asterisk
        answers the call and then goes into a Wait() application. During
        this time, we connect to Asterisk using AMI and request various
        parameters of the channel that has been created. We ensure that
        the values of the variables match what we expect them to.

        Note that for now, the minimum version of this test is Asterisk
        trunk. This is because there are fields referenced in the test
        which do not exist in other branches of Asterisk."
