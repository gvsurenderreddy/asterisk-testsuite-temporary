;	Sample extensions.conf.  Replace this dialplan with the extensions
;	needed for your test.  Note that each instance of Asterisk has its
;	directory under configs, and will correspond with the instances of
;	Asterisk in the TestCase.ast list.  So, the configuration files for
;	ast1 will match the first the Asterisk object in TestCase.ast.
;
;	Any Asterisk configuration file can be placed in this directory.  They
;	will override the default Asterisk configuration files used by the
;	testsuite.  It is encouraged to use includes where possible - see
;	the configs/ subdirectory.
