    summary:     'Test transfer member after caller hangup [F()] option for queues'
    description: |
        'When a member of a queue (the callee) is connected to someone who called a queue application
         (the caller) with option F(), and the caller hangs up, then the callee will be transfered to
         a place in the dialplan specified by the argument to the F option. This test verifies that
         the callee is transferred to the expected extensions for a number of Queues with different
         arguments of F().'
