test-info:
    summary: 'Tests basic ChannelRedirect functionality.'
    description:
        The first scenario has a local channel send both ends into the Echo()
        application. A second channel is then called that redirects the first channel
        into another extension that hangs up immediately. CHANNELREDIRECT_STATUS
        should then return SUCCESS.
        The second scenario only calls one channel and tries to redirect a non-existent
        channel to an extension. CHANNELREDIRECT_STATUS should return NOCHANNEL.
