exten => 1234,n,Playback(demo-thanks) ; pad length while waiting for exten 2000 to hangup.
exten => 1234,n,Playback(demo-thanks) ; pad a little more length to give 101 time to be transferred so that the masqueraded channel can go away.
exten => 1234,n,UserEvent(stop_mix_test, status: CHECKSTOP) ; If mixmonitor has already stopped, that means inherit didn't work properly.
exten => 1234,n,Playback(demo-thanks) ; This should be recorded by the mixmonitor in 101
