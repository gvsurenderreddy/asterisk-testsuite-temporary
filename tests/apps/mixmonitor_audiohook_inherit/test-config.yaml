    summary:     'Test MixMonitor with AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT'
    description: |
        'This test verifies basic functionality using MixMonitor with
         AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT. To test this, an extension is called using the
         Local channel driver. MixMonitor and AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT are used on
         that channel and then the channel is transfered to another extension.
         After the transfer, audio is played back for a period of time. In
         order to verify AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT worked properly, the AMI listener
         will check for a user event and a test event indicating that a
         MixMonitor is ending. If the MixMonitor Ending event comes before the
         user event, the test is failed since that indicates the audiohook
         was not bound to the channel that sent the user event. If that
         succeeds, the recording file size is checked to verify it is the size
         we would expect.  If AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT did not work properly, the file
         size would be much smaller than what we expect since we play several
         seconds of audio after the transfer.'
