    summary: 'Test nominal execution of app_voicemails VoiceMail dialplan application'
    description: |
        This test verifies proper functionality of an operator leaving a voicemail.  It verifies
        a bare-bones voicemail, wherein app_voicemail plays back a default greeting, records
        a voicemail on the filesystem, and hangs up on the caller when the caller presses the pound
        key or hangs up.
