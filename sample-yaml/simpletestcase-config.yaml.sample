# Configuration sample for the SimpleTestCase object, a test object derived from
# TestCase that manages a single instance of Asterisk. The SimpleTestCase will
# Originate a sequence of Local channels into the dialplan. Each iteration of a
# test can be initiated either by a UserEvent or by the Hangup of the previous
# iteration.
# This test case is useful for lots of simple tests where you simply need to
# drive a channel into Asterisk.

test-object-config:

	# The number of expected UserEvents that should be received before ending
	# the current test iteration. Note that this option only needs to be used
	# when a test iteration is decided by the reception of UserEvents and not
	# by the reception of a Hangup event for the Originated channel.
	expected-events: 3

	# Swallow any deferred exceptions that occur as the result of an error
	# from an AMI Originate. If you expect your channel to not get
	# Answered, then you probably should set this to True.
	ignore-originate-failures: True

	# Set this option to true if you want each test iteration to start when
	# the previous iteration's channel has hung up.
	spawn-after-hangup: True

	# A path to a configuration directory other than this test's configuration
	# directory. The configuration files from this common directory will be
	# installed prior to this test's configuration files. This is useful for
	# large sets of tests that cover the same functionality, and allows them
	# to share config files.
	config-path: 'tests/foo'

	# The test iterations block define a sequence of sets of scenarios to run
	# sequentially
	test-iterations:
		-
			# The channel to create
			channel: Local/foo@default
			# The application to drop the ;1 side of the Local channel into
			application: Echo
		-
			# The next channel to create
			channel: Local/bar@default
			# The application to drop the ;1 side of the Local channel into
			application: Echo
